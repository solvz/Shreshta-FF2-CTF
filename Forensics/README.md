# **Forensics Challenges**

**Log Analysis - 1Description:**

_“During a routine server audit, suspicious logins were detected at precise hourly intervals from 00:00 to 02:00. The security team managed to capture both the authentication logs (auth.log) and system logs (syslog) from the compromised server._

_Can you piece together the logs and reveal what was exfiltrated from the system?”_

**Disk - 1: Y2K RelicDescription:**

_“We found an old floppy disk from December 31, 1999. The files' timestamps seem corrupted due to Y2K concerns, but one file holds vital information.”_

**Disk - 2: Historian’s Corrupted DriveDescription:**

_“The drive belonged to a renowned historian who was investigating anomalies in historical timelines. According to the Institute, the historian had uncovered evidence of a major historical event that never officially happened—a secret so profound that it could change our understanding of history itself._

_Unfortunately, the drive was severely damaged in a lab accident, and the historian's research is now inaccessible. Your mission is to recover the lost data and uncover the truth hidden within.”_
